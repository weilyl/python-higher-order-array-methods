# Python higher order array methods

In the spirit of learning in public, I'm rewriting my old JavaScript assignments in Python. 

To practice test-driven development (TDD), I'm also rewriting the Jest unit tests with the `unittest` Python module. I've used GitHub Actions to implement pre-commit testing.

To run the tests:
    `python3 test_exercises.py`
